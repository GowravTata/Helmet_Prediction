Since, motorcycles are affordable and a daily mode of transport, there has been a rapid increase in motorcycle accidents due to the fact that most of the motorcyclists do not  wear a helmet which makes it an ever-present danger every day to travel by motorcycle [1], [2]. In the last couple of years alone most of the deaths in accidents are due to damage in the head [3]. Because of this wearing helmet is mandatory as per traffic rules, violation of which attract hefty fines. Inspite, a large number of motorcyclists do not obey the rule. Presently,all major cities already deployed large video surveillance network to keep a vigil on a wide variety of threats. Thus using such already existing system will be a cost efficient solution, however these systems involve a large number of humans whose performance is not sustainable for long periods of time. Recent studies have shown that human surveillance proves ineffective, as the duration of monitoring of videos increases, the errors made by humans also increases.
